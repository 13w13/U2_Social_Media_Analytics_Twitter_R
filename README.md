~1 week development  

## Introduction

In this project, we are going to use the Advanced Social Media Analytics course in order to study the international impact of a French tv-show : Arsene Lupin. In our course, we learned how to use the api of twitter in order to establish anlaysis with the R language. Indeed, studying the tweets following the release of a series broadcast on an international platform such as Netflix allows us to better understand the reception of the show after an audiance and to measure its popularity.   

Given the limiation of the free version of tweeter api, we can download only tweets within a 7-days windows. This is why we have chosen to study the Arsene Lupin show available on Netflix on January 7, 2021. Arsene Lupin is a rare French series on Netflix featuring an internationally known French actor (mostly from the US audience), spoken in French, whose main character is an icon of French theft and whose main venue is Paris.
